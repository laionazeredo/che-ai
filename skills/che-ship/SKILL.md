# Che — Ship (commit + push + open PR)

> **SHARED REFERENCES (CANONICAL — DO NOT DUPLICATE body here):**
> - Conventional Commits full types + regex + examples: engineering-contracts skill Appendix B
> - GitHub CLI gh auth + push + create PR commands: `_shared_checklists/GITHUB_CLI_COMMON.md`
> - gh-stack hierarchical PR workflow (multi-PR partial deliveries): engineering-contracts Appendix C
> - Light pre-ship security check: `_shared_checklists/SECURITY_PII_COMMON.md` (secrets leak, PII log scan)

This skill handles the end-of-development workflow for a worktree.
It runs ONLY after the user says "I believe everything is OK" and is prepared to commit.

---

## 0. Preconditions — Non-negotiable (FAIL if any missing)

1. **Worktree confirmed.** Absolute path provided. If not — block.
2. **`gh` CLI is available and authenticated.** Run `gh auth status` silently. If not authenticated → guide user to `gh auth login` and stop.
3. **Worktree has uncommitted changes OR new commits ready to push.** `git status` is not clean OR branch is behind/ahead.
4. No uncommitted `.env` / secret files being committed.
5. (If the user ran via che) all tasks are marked DONE in `task_graph.md`. Compliance + scope + review gates are EXECUTABLE CODE in §0.9.1→§0.9.4 and will run NOW before any git operation; §0.5 item 5 legacy-text compliance requirement is replaced entirely by gate §0.9.3 execution. If user explicitly passed `--skip-gates` (override flag): log EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE entry to decision.log with user verbatim justification, SKIP all 4 gates, jump directly to §1 Git Housekeeping. No other bypass path exists.

If any precondition fails → report exactly which, stop execution, ask user.

### 0.6 gh-stack mode detection (N4 hierarchical PR stack)

1. Check if file exists: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/gh_stack_plan.md` (via `source "${CHE_HOME:-$HOME/.trae}/contracts/che_sessions_contract.sh"`).
2. If it exists:
   - Read it. Validate it has a field `Status: APPROVED` at the top.
   - Check `gh` extension installed: run `gh extension list 2>/dev/null | grep -i "stack"` silently.
   - If gh-stack extension NOT installed → offer `gh extension install https://github.com/github/gh-stack` to user; wait for confirmation, install, then continue. If user declines → FALLBACK to single-PR mode (Steps 2–5 normal path).
   - Parse layers table bottom-up (first layer = lowest in the stack, merged first; last layer = top of stack). Extract per layer: `Layer ID`, `Branch Name` (slug like `PROJ-123-l1-refund-pipeline`), `Scope (files)`, `Depends on`.
   - Set boolean: `GH_STACK_MODE=true`. Record `LAYERS[]` array ordered bottom-up.
3. If file NOT exists OR status ≠ APPROVED → `GH_STACK_MODE=false`. Proceed with standard single-PR path (Steps 2–5 current).

### 0.7 WORKTREE SESSION BINDING PREFLIGHT (engineering-contracts §19, NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Run BEFORE any `git status / git add / git commit / git push`. PREVENTS wrong-worktree commits.

1. **Level 1 Global Index (AUTHORITY):** Read `che_registry_path`. Find LAST STATUS=BOUND entry using the effective session id from `che_current_session_id`. Extract WORKTREE_ROOT from that entry.
   - If NO entry: SHIP BLOCKED NOW. Ask "No Level1 binding for this session. Create before ship? (A = Select worktree; B = Cancel ship)." NEVER ship unbound.
   - If found BOUND entry: confirm WORKTREE_ROOT from registry **MUST EQUAL** WORKTREE_ROOT precondition 1.
   - MISMATCH → **BLOCK SHIP NOW.** Ask: "Level 1 GLOBAL registry binding says worktree = X, ship was invoked on Y. Which one actually ships? (A = X per binding; B = Y override binding + rebind; C = Cancel ship)." Never silent-continue.
2. **Level 2 Detail File (optional audit):** Verify `$CHE_SESSION_DIR/binding.md` exists (via `source "${CHE_HOME:-$HOME/.trae}/contracts/che_sessions_contract.sh"`). If missing → warn decision.log entry (SM skipped Level 2 write). Do NOT block ship (Level 1 is the authority).
3. **Scissor check staging + file ops:**
   - EVERY file staged/committed → path MUST start with WORKTREE_ROOT from Level1 registry.
   - Generated files under `$CHE_SESSIONS_ROOT/**` are NEVER staged; they live outside user code by design.
   - File path outside WORKTREE_ROOT and not under CHE_SESSIONS_ROOT (symlinks, relative tricks, etc.) → UNSTAGE immediately, report, DO NOT commit.
4. **Cross-worktree safety during ship loop (gh-stack mode):**
   - After finishing layer's commit/push/PR, NEXT layer file ops → RE-RUN scissor check (3) against BOUND WORKTREE_ROOT registry entry.
   - Never silent cd another worktree during multi-layer ship. Layer says "use worktree B" → STOP. Ask user confirm re-binding §19.3 (old entry STATUS=RELEASED append new BOUND registry entry) before switching.

---

### 0.7.1 MANDATORY STORAGE PREFLIGHT (run IMMEDIATELY after §0.7, BEFORE §0.8 or ANY report/decision write)

BEFORE generating ANY report file (gates 0.9.1→0.9.5), decision log, backup artifact: execute EXACTLY this command ONCE per /che-ship execution. **Ensures all paths resolve OUTSIDE the worktree:**

```bash
python3 -m che_core.ship preflight "$WORKTREE_ROOT" "$SESSION_ID"
```

Export the variables printed by the script to use them in the next gates.

---

### 0.8 PLANNING ARTIFACTS BLACKLIST PREFLIGHT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Purpose:** NEVER allow che internal planning/decision files to end up in user-code PRs. If any bug/legacy skill accidentally creates them inside the user worktree, detect, unstage, and DELETE them before any `git add` runs.

Execute the blacklist verification script:

```bash
python3 -m che_core.ship blacklist_check "$WORKTREE_ROOT" "$SESSION_ID"
```

If the script reports tracked files (exit code 2), present options (A or B) to the user as suggested in the output.

---

## 0.9 EXECUTABLE QUALITY GATES (RUN BEFORE ANY GIT OPERATION — FAIL FAST ORDER)

> **CANONICAL 4-PASS ORDER (non-negotiable — fail-fast by blast radius):**
> 1. **§0.9.1 Scope + Lean delivery** (lowest compute cost, highest blast radius if wrong — shipping the wrong thing is the worst scenario)
> 2. **§0.9.2 Code Review bugs** (depends on scope being correct; ≤2 HIGH = auto-remediate WITHOUT asking)
> 3. **§0.9.3 Compliance security/PII** (since review and scope passed, we guarantee 0C 0H)
> 4. **§0.9.4 QA — DEFAULT ON, 3 profiles: minimal / normal / full** (no flag = `minimal` profile; `--qa=<profile>` flag selects; unique bypass = user EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE logged in decision.log)
>
> Any GATE with 🔴 status BLOCKS the ship. Gates 0.9.1 and 0.9.3 NEVER have auto-fix. Only Gate 0.9.2 has an auto-fix branch when threshold ≤ 2 HIGH findings. Gate 0.9.4 DOES NOT have a `--no-run-qa` flag. The only way to bypass is user EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE.

### 0.9.1 GATE 1 — che-scope-checker 6-checks (Mode B: Local Worktree)

**Purpose:** Ensure that what is about to be committed (1) delivers EVERYTHING promised in the scope and (2) has no overengineering / bloat / YAGNI violations. Executes the `che-scope-checker` skill in Mode B.

**Internal precondition of this gate:**
- `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED` resolved via `source "${CHE_HOME:-${HARNESS_HOME:-$HOME/.trae}}/contracts/che_sessions_contract.sh"`.

**Scope source auto-discover order (first match wins — DOES NOT cascade multiple sources):**
1. **Explicit envelope** → does `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/tasks/*/envelope.md` exist? (last DONE task in task_graph, take its envelope) → SCOPE_SOURCE=ENVELOPE.
2. **Local task graph** → does `<WORKTREE_ROOT>/task_graph.md` exist? → SCOPE_SOURCE=TASK_GRAPH. Reads list of Acceptance Criteria + Tasks marked DONE.
3. **Local/global che spec** → does `spec_*.md` exist in `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/spec_*.md` OR `<WORKTREE_ROOT>/spec_*.md`? → SCOPE_SOURCE=SPEC. Extracts §5 Acceptance Criteria section.
4. **GitHub PR body (if PR URL provided via `--pr-url` flag)** → use `gh pr view <URL> --json body,title` → parse Acceptance Criteria bullet points. SCOPE_SOURCE=PR_BODY.
5. **No source found** → ⚠️ WARN + ASK user: "No scope source located. (A) Inform spec/envelope path manually; (B) Proceed WITHOUT scope validation (risk: shipping out of scope); (C) Cancel ship." If user chooses B → log EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE in decision.log, SKIP this gate, go to 0.9.2.

**Execution:**
1. Invoke `che-scope-checker` skill passing:
   - `--worktree <WORKTREE_ROOT>`
   - `--mode B`
   - `--scope-source <SCOPE_SOURCE>`
   - `--scope-path <file_path>`
   - `--report-out "$SHIP_SCOPE_CHECK_REPORT"` (variable from §0.7.1; UTC timestamp prefix + report/ship-wt-<slug>/ structure outside worktree)
2. Wait for return with `verdict` field + `final_score` field + `findings[]` (CHECK 1-6).

**Verdict handling (EXACT che-scope-checker §8 rule):**
| scope-checker Verdict | Gate 0.9.1 Action | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 APPROVED (score ≥7.0 AND 0 🔴 in CHECKS 1–6) | ✅ PASS GATE 1 | Proceed immediately to §0.9.2 |
| 🟡 CONDITIONS (score ≥7.0 but has some non-blocking action item OR score 5.0–6.9) | ⏸️ PAUSE + ASK user | Print findings and action items to user. EXACT options: **(A) = Apply suggested fixes and re-run gate 1; (B) = Conditionally approve (mandatory justification → recorded via decision.log helper); (C) = Cancel ship.** |
| 🔴 REJECTED (score <5.0 OR any 🔴 in CHECK 1 Delivery / CHECK 4 Env / CHECK 3 Mandatory Docs) | 🔴 BLOCK SHIP | Present findings to user. DOES NOT offer direct override option (requires new round). Suggest: fix → run standalone /che-scope-checker → then re-run /che-ship. |

**Output artifacts:**
- `$SHIP_SCOPE_CHECK_REPORT` — full 6-checks report with SCOPE × LEAN final score. Final structure: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/ship-<wt-slug>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-ship-scope-check.md` (sorted by timestamp prefix, grouped by related worktree).
- Decision log entry via official helper: `che_append_decision_jsonl "SHIP_GATE_0_9_1" "verdict=${verdict} score=${final_score} source=${SCOPE_SOURCE} report=${SHIP_SCOPE_CHECK_REPORT}"`.
- NO artifact is created inside `<WORKTREE_ROOT>` (assert outside helper already locks exit 99 if path lands there; §0.8 blacklist ensures redundant cleanup).

### 0.9.2 GATE 2 — che-code-review Mode B Local Worktree + **THRESHOLD ≤ 2 HIGH AUTO-FIX RULE (USER VERBATIM CONTRACT)**

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE USER VERBATIM RULE:**
> _"in the case of code review, in the case of <= 2 high findings, already fix and commit and proceed with ship without even asking me. But otherwise, perfect."_
> **This rule has no exceptions.** ASK NOTHING to the user in the ≤ 2 HIGH branch. Auto-remediate, commit, proceed. If CRITICAL ≥1 or HIGH ≥3 → block and present.

**Purpose:** Run `che-code-review` skill in **Mode B — Local Worktree** (diff of current worktree against `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` already determined in preamble). Post-processing of the result with the ≤ 2 HIGH threshold rule.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

**Step 2.0 — Base diff preparation:**
1. Reuse `DEFAULT_BRANCH` which will already be determined in §1.2 (if gate 2 runs before §1, just execute `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` silently).
2. Base diff = `origin/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>..HEAD` (commits already made in this branch) PLUS current unstaged + uncommitted changes in worktree. **Both are reviewed.** Not just staged.

**Step 2.1 — che-code-review invocation:**
1. Invoke `che-code-review` skill with params:
   - `--worktree <WORKTREE_ROOT>`
   - `--mode B`
   - `--base origin/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>`
   - `--report-out "$SHIP_CODE_REVIEW_REPORT"` (variable from §0.7.1; helper guaranteed outside worktree)
   - `--include-unstaged true`
2. Wait for structured result: `{ critical_count: N, high_count: N, medium_count: N, low_count: N, findings: [...] }`
   - Each finding has: `{ severity: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW, file, line, title, suggested_fix_code_block (optional), auto_fixable: boolean }`.

**Step 2.2 — THRESHOLD BRANCHING (core user rule — IMPLEMENT EXACTLY):**

```
IF (critical_count === 0) AND (high_count <= 2):
    → AUTO-REMEDIATE-AND-CONTINUE BRANCH (WITHOUT ASKING ANYTHING TO USER — NEVER ASK HERE)
ELSE:
    → BLOCK-SHIP BRANCH (present findings to user)
```

---

#### BRANCH A: AUTO-REMEDIATE-AND-CONTINUE (0 CRITICAL + ≤ 2 HIGH)

**Goal:** Automatically fix HIGH findings that are `auto_fixable=true`, commit with conventional commit, and proceed to gate 0.9.3 **without any user interaction.**

**2.A.1 — Filter auto-fixable HIGH findings:**
```
<FIXABLE_HIGHS> = findings.filter(f => f.severity === 'HIGH' AND f.auto_fixable === true)
<UNFIXABLE_HIGHS> = findings.filter(f => f.severity === 'HIGH' AND f.auto_fixable === false)
```
- `UNFIXABLE_HIGHS` (if any, ≤ 2 total): **still proceed without asking user.** The rule is ≤2 total HIGH, regardless of being fixable or not. Log WARNING in decision.log with each unfixable finding listed. DO NOT block.

**2.A.2 — Apply fixes programmatically:**
For each `f` in `<FIXABLE_HIGHS>`:
1. Read target file (via Read tool, guaranteed latest content).
2. Apply `Edit` tool exactly using `f.suggested_fix_code_block` as `new_string`, replacing corresponding old_string.
3. DO NOT add comments in edits. Maintain file style.
4. If any Edit fails (old_string mismatch): **abort only this specific finding**, log `AUTO_REMEDIATE_FAILED` in decision.log with file+line, continue with others. Do not abort Branch A.

**2.A.3 — Commit remediation with conventional commit (WITHOUT going through normal §1 — special commit):**
```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_ROOT"
# 1. Re-run §0.8 blacklist stages 1-2 just for safety (ensure no artifact entered diff):
#    (run same §0.8 stage 1 + 2 commands for unstaged)
# 2. Stage only files modified by auto-fixes:
git add -- <files_changed_by_fixes>
# 3. EXACT conventional commit:
N_FIXED=<total_high_fixes_applied>
N_TOTAL_HIGH=<high_count>
git commit -m "fix(review): auto-remediate code review HIGH findings ($N_FIXED/$N_TOTAL_HIGH)

- Applied automated remediation for ≤ 2 HIGH findings per ship gate 0.9.2 rule
- Remediation source: che-code-review Mode B against origin/<DEFAULT_BRANCH>
- Unfixed HIGH (<= count) logged to decision.log as AUTO_REMEDIATE_UNFIXABLE"
```

**2.A.4 — Post-commit:**
- Decision log entry via official helper:
  ```bash
  che_append_decision_jsonl "SHIP_GATE_0_9_2" "verdict=AUTO_REMEDIATED_PASSED critical=0 high=${N_TOTAL_HIGH} auto_applied=${N_FIXED} auto_failed=${Y} report=${SHIP_CODE_REVIEW_REPORT}"
  ```
- **PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO GATE §0.9.3.** DO NOT RETURN to normal §1 Git Housekeeping. Special commit already done. Normal §1 will run and account only for remaining changes (if any).

---

#### BRANCH B: BLOCK SHIP (CRITICAL ≥ 1 OR HIGH ≥ 3)

**Rule:** Present detailed findings to user and ask for input. NO auto-fix in this branch.

EXACT options to user:
```
🔴 SHIP GATE 0.9.2 CODE REVIEW BLOCKED
  Summary: <critical_count> CRITICAL · <high_count> HIGH · <medium_count> MEDIUM · <low_count> LOW

  (Top findings first — print only CRITICAL + HIGH to user; medium/low go to report only)

Options:
  A = I want to apply fixes MANUALLY now. Pause ship, back to interactive shell.
      (After user fixes, they run /che-ship again)
  B = Reject specific findings + override. Need: mandatory justification per
      finding to be overridden (save to decision.log).
  C = Cancel ship.
```

If user chooses B (override):
- Each overridden finding requires free-text justification.
- All saved in decision.log as `REVIEW_OVERRIDE {finding_id, justification}` entries.
- Change gate verdict to PASSED_WITH_OVERRIDES.
- **ONLY ALLOW OVERRIDE UP TO 2 HIGH total.** If HIGH ≥3 → option B is disabled.
- **NEVER PERMIT CRITICAL OVERRIDE — option B disabled if critical_count > 0.**

---

**Output artifacts gate 0.9.2:**
- `$SHIP_CODE_REVIEW_REPORT` — full findings report. Final structure: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/ship-<wt-slug>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-ship-code-review.md` (sorted, grouped).
- Decision log entries via `che_append_decision_jsonl` helper according to Branch A or B.
- Branch B: If OVERRIDE, each overridden finding uses: `che_append_decision_jsonl "REVIEW_OVERRIDE" "finding_id=${id} justification=${text}"`.
- Branch A has 1 new commit in worktree prefixed `fix(review): auto-remediate...`.

---

### 0.9.3 GATE 3 — che-compliance HEAVY FULL SCAN (Heavy Step 2, not just diff)

**Purpose:** Ensure 0 CRITICAL + 0 HIGH findings in the **ENTIRE REPO**, not just the diff. Executes the `che-compliance` skill in its HEAVY Step 2 version (full-session scan, not diff-only). This is the old §0.5 compliance rule, now turned into executable code.

**Execution:**
1. Invoke `che-compliance` skill with params:
   - `--worktree <WORKTREE_ROOT>`
   - `--mode HEAVY_STEP_2_FULL_SCAN`
   - `--report-out "$SHIP_COMPLIANCE_HEAVY_REPORT"` (variable from §0.7.1; helper guaranteed outside worktree)
   - `--required 0_CRITICAL_AND_0_HIGH`
2. Wait for result: `{ critical_count: N, high_count: N, scan_categories_ran: [1..15] }`

**Verdict handling:**
| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| `critical_count === 0 AND high_count === 0` | ✅ PASS GATE 3. Proceed to 0.9.4. |
| Any `critical_count > 0` OR `high_count > 0` | 🔴 **BLOCK SHIP — NO DIRECT OVERRIDE OPTION.** Present CRITICAL + HIGH list to user with paths and lines. Options: (A) Fix manually and re-run /che-ship; (B) Run standalone `che-compliance` first for verbose output, then return. |

**Compliance categories guaranteed to run (canonical from che-compliance skill Step 2 Heavy):**
- Category 1: Secrets leak (hardcoded API keys sk-*, AWS, JWT in text)
- Category 2: PII exposure (raw email log/return, SSN, sensitive data)
- Category 3: SQL injection patterns (string concat in SQL, no parameterisation)
- Category 4: Auth / RLS bypass patterns
- Category 5: Dangerous URLs (SSRF, open redirect)
- Categories 6-15: remaining from che-compliance skill.

**Output artifacts:**
- `$SHIP_COMPLIANCE_HEAVY_REPORT` — full scan report. Final structure: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/ship-<wt-slug>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-ship-compliance-heavy.md` (sorted, grouped).
- Decision log entry via official helper: `che_append_decision_jsonl "SHIP_GATE_0_9_3" "verdict=${verdict} critical=${critical_count} high=${high_count} categories=${#scan_categories_ran} report=${SHIP_COMPLIANCE_HEAVY_REPORT}"`.

---

### 0.9.4 GATE 4 — QA Gate (DEFAULT ON — `minimal` profile if no flag passed)

**Purpose:** Last line of defence before real commit. **ON BY DEFAULT — ALWAYS runs, unless user passes justified EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE.** 3 speed/comprehensiveness profiles. NO more `--no-run-qa` flag.

**Profile resolution (non-negotiable precedence):**
1. User passed `--skip-qa` in command → **REQUIRE user verbatim EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE** recorded in decisions.log. Without written override → **BLOCK SHIP NOW, ask user justification.**
2. User passed `--qa=full` → **PROFILE_FULL** (everything, ~5-15min)
3. User passed `--qa=normal` → **PROFILE_NORMAL** (affected typecheck+lint+test, ~1-3min)
4. **DEFAULT** (no QA flag) → **PROFILE_MINIMAL** (only affected unit/integ tests, ~30s-2min)

**When skipped (ONLY path 1):**
- If `--skip-qa` present AND EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE `QA_SKIP` recorded via `che_append_decision_jsonl "SHIP_GATE_0_9_4_OVERRIDE" "verbatim=<user justification>"` → SKIP, proceed to §1.
- **ANY OTHER skip path (without logged override) → BLOCKS SHIP.**

**Profile specs (stack-detect execution):**

Automatically detects monorepo stack (attempt order):
1. **Nx workspace (pnpm + nx)** → `nx.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exist:
   | Profile | Command chain | Target duration |
   |---|---|---|
   | 🟢 **MINIMAL (default)** | `cd "$WORKTREE_ROOT" && corepack pnpm nx affected:test --tui false --exclude=e2e 2>&1` (only unit/integ tests AFFECTED by dirty files — NO typecheck, NO lint, NO playwright/e2e) | ~30s-2min monorepo |
   | 🟡 **NORMAL (--qa=normal)** | `cd "$WORKTREE_ROOT" && { echo "===== QA GATE NORMAL: typecheck $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx affected:typecheck --tui false 2>&1; echo "===== QA GATE NORMAL: lint $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx affected:lint --tui false 2>&1; echo "===== QA GATE NORMAL: test $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx affected:test --tui false --exclude=e2e 2>&1; }` — affected: typecheck + lint + unit/integ tests | ~1-3min monorepo |
   | 🔴 **FULL (--qa=full)** | `cd "$WORKTREE_ROOT" && { echo "===== QA GATE FULL: typecheck $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx run-many --target=typecheck --tui false 2>&1; echo "===== QA GATE FULL: lint $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx run-many --target=lint --tui false 2>&1; echo "===== QA GATE FULL: unit+integ tests $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx run-many --target=test --tui false 2>&1; echo "===== QA GATE FULL: E2E tests $(date -Iseconds) ====="; corepack pnpm nx run-many --target=e2e --tui false 2>&1; }` — all: typecheck+lint+unit+integ+e2e+playwright | ~5-15min monorepo |
   Every output from any profile is recorded via pipe: `| che_write_file_atomic "$SHIP_QA_GATE_LOG"`

2. **Generic pnpm/npm/yarn (no Nx)** → `package.json` exists:
   - MINIMAL: heuristic find matching test files: `grep` diff paths → run only `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files matching changed file dirs via `corepack pnpm vitest run <matched_paths>` (no typecheck, no lint)
   - NORMAL: `{ echo typecheck; corepack pnpm typecheck 2>&1; echo lint; corepack pnpm lint 2>&1; echo test; corepack pnpm test 2>&1; }`
   - FULL: all NORMAL + `corepack pnpm test:e2e 2>&1` (if script exists; otherwise WARN and skip)

3. **No detection** → WARN "Could not detect QA stack. MINIMAL fallback: attempts to run test command documented in AGENTS.md. If none → WARN + SKIP gate with decision.log entry SKIPPED_STACK_NOT_DETECTED".

**QA Verdict handling:**
- **MINIMAL profile:** only test command — exit code 0 → ✅ PASS. exit code != 0 → 🔴 BLOCK SHIP.
- **NORMAL profile:** exit code 0 in ALL 3 (typecheck + lint + test) → ✅ PASS. Any failure → 🔴 BLOCK.
- **FULL profile:** exit code 0 in ALL → ✅ PASS. Any failure → 🔴 BLOCK.
- **In any BLOCK (0.9.4):** Print tail -80 of error output to user. EXACT options:
  - (A) I want to fix manually now → pause ship, back to interactive shell (then user re-runs /che-ship).
  - (B) Override (REQUIRE user verbatim EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE text justifying WHY failing typecheck/lint/test MUST SHIP now — recorded in decision.log; override only allowed if (i) failure count is ≤2 known FLAKY tests AND (ii) justification cites an issue/ticket).

**Output artifacts:**
- `$SHIP_QA_GATE_LOG` — concatenated stdout of selected profile. Final structure: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/ship-<wt-slug>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-ship-qa-gate.log` (sortable timestamp, grouped). Atomic write via `che_write_file_atomic` stdin pipe.
- Decision log entry via helper: `che_append_decision_jsonl "SHIP_GATE_0_9_4" "verdict=${verdict} profile=${MINIMAL|NORMAL|FULL} tc_status=${status} lint_status=${status} test_status=${status} e2e_status=${status|N/A} override_logged=${yes|no} log=${SHIP_QA_GATE_LOG} evidence_manifest_sha256=${QA_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_SHA:-N/A} evidence_workspace_path=${QA_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_PATH:-N/A}"`.

### 0.9.5 GATE 5 (NEW Three-Layer Domains v2) — Mandatory DOMAIN GATES for Non-Engineering Domains

> **Precedence order resolve effective_domain (STOP at first non-null match):** (1) SPEC frontmatter `domain:` field → (2) Project Level 1.5 registry `domains[0]` array first entry → (3) DEFAULT FALLBACK `engineering`.

Purpose: Same fail-fast engine G1-G4 generalised for ANY domain (ux/product/devops/copywriting/social/seo-analytics) using numerical thresholds, 1 automatic free retry, and HUMAN REQUIRED after 2nd failure. Same as engineering-contracts §6 DbC + §15 incremental BDD pattern. No "taste" or subjective evaluation allowed — all NUMERICAL threshold.

Execution steps (fixed order):

1. **Resolve `effective_domain`:** Read SPEC (same path as gate 0.9.1 scope) YAML `domain:` + fallback project registry `domains[]`. If both null/missing → `effective_domain = engineering`.
2. **IF `effective_domain === 'engineering'` → **SKIP GATE 5 COMPLETELY AND SILENTLY (0 log lines, 0 extra output).** Old sessions/specs WITHOUT `domain:` field have IDENTICAL behaviour to original v2. 100% backward compat guaranteed.
3. **IF `effective_domain !== 'engineering':`**
   a. **Check folder exists:** `${CHE_HOME:-$HOME/.trae}/domains/<effective_domain>/gates/` → MUST exist. Does not exist → **WARN "Domain <slug> has no gates implemented yet (phase 2 rollout). Skip §0.9.5."** Log decision entry helper:
      ```bash
      che_append_decision_jsonl "DOMAIN-GATES-WARN" "domain=${effective_domain} reason=no-gates-folder phase-2-rollout skip=TRUE"
      ```
      Proceed §0.9.6 ALL GATES PASSED normally.
   b. **Glob + sort alphabetical gate files:** `${CHE_HOME:-$HOME/.trae}/domains/<effective_domain>/gates/*.md`. Execution order = filename alphabetical order (same as G1→G2→G3→G4 convention). UX example: `accessibility-gate.md` executes BEFORE `pixel-check-gate.md`.
   c. **For EACH gate file (0.9.5.1, 0.9.5.2, ...):**
      - Parse file YAML frontmatter: `threshold_pass`, `retry_policy`, `log_format_decisions`, `tool_official`.
      - If frontmatter missing → FAIL gate immediately: "Gate <filename> has no declared YAML threshold frontmatter. Invalid domain."
      - **Build report path PER gate using helper (one JSON file per gate, sorted, grouped):**
        ```bash
        GATE_BASENAME="$(basename "$gate_file" .md)"
        DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT="$(che_output_path "${SHIP_DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT_TEMPLATE_TYPE}" "domain-gate-${effective_domain}-${GATE_BASENAME}" "${RELATED_ID}" "${SHIP_DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT_TEMPLATE_SCOPE}" "json")"
        ```
      - **Run gate evaluation (automatic):** Follow EXACTLY the steps listed in `domains/<slug>/gates/<name>.md` "Execution" section. Record all gate output in JSON report via `che_write_file_atomic "$DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT"` (atomic write, guaranteed outside worktree). If gate uses an official tool via §21 External Connectors (P1 MCP or P2 CLI): ALWAYS use P1→P2 order channels; NEVER raw curl/fetch.
      - `PASS condition`: `threshold_pass` frontmatter satisfied NUMERICALLY (e.g. `score >= 8.0`, `critical_count === 0`). If string → FAIL.
      - Verdict:
        | 1st round gate result | Action |
        |---|---|
        | 🟢 PASS threshold | ✅ Passes this gate. Decision log helper: `che_append_decision_jsonl "DOMAIN-GATE-EXECUTED" "domain=${effective_domain} gate=${GATE_BASENAME} status=PASS score=${score} duration_ms=${ms} report=${DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT}"`. Next gate. |
        | 🔴 FAIL threshold (1st time) | **AUTOMATIC FREE Retry = 1 single round:** Apply recommended steps in gate file "Retry Policy" section (e.g. "fix top-3 deviations >4px", "fix missing alt"). Re-run gate 1 NEW time. Decision log helper for retry: `che_append_decision_jsonl "DOMAIN-GATE-RETRY" "domain=${effective_domain} gate=${GATE_BASENAME} score_before=${sb} retry=1"`. |
        | 🔴 FAIL threshold AFTER automatic retry = 2nd failure | **HARD STOP §0.9.5 DOMAIN GATES.** Does not open PR. Does not commit. Does not proceed to §0.9.6. Decision log HELPER with details: `che_append_decision_jsonl "DOMAIN-GATE-HARD-FAIL" "domain=${effective_domain} gate=${GATE_BASENAME} threshold=${orig} score_now=${sn} report=${DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT}"`. Show standardised message to user. |
   d. **After all gates PASS or explicit override logged:** All gates passed OR user gave verbatim EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE logged in decisions → Log FINAL gate 5 entry HELPER: `che_append_decision_jsonl "DOMAIN-GATES-ALL-PASSED" "domain=${effective_domain} n_gates=${N} overrides=${COUNT} duration_total_ms=${ms}"`. Proceed §0.9.6.
4. **EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE rules (same as G2 code-review today):** Threshold is NEVER lowered automatically by agent. ONLY allowed if user LITERALLY typed "EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE domain=<slug> gate=<X> old=<threshold> new=<n> reason=<TEXT>" in chat. In this condition: log HELPER entry `che_append_decision_jsonl "EXPLICIT_OVERRIDE" "domain=${effective_domain} gate=${GATE_BASENAME} old=${OLD} new=${NEW} reason=${TEXT} trace_id=${TRACE_ID}"` and mark gate as "PASS (WITH OVERRIDE)". No other bypass form exists. Do not trust "seems OK".

**Output artifacts gate 0.9.5:**
- 1 decision.log entry PER executed gate (PASS/FAIL/RETRY/OVERRIDE), **all via official `che_append_decision_jsonl` helper.**
- Report per gate: `$DOMAIN_GATE_REPORT` (1 JSON file per gate, dynamically built via `che_output_path` inside loop). Final structure: `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/ship-<wt-slug>/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-domain-gate-<dom>-<name>.json` (timestamp prefix = sorted; all files of same ship stay in SAME `report/ship-<wt-slug>/` subfolder → easy to search glob `**/ship-<slug>/*`).

**Blacklist check:** Reports are 100% in `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/<related_id>/` (helper guaranteed outside assert). §0.8 + §2.2 continue to ensure no report/diff artifact/decisions log enters user commit diff.

---

### 0.9.6 ALL GATES PASSED — Transition guard

**Appears only if 0.9.1 ✅ + 0.9.2 ✅ (any branch that passed) + 0.9.3 ✅ + 0.9.4 ✅ OR SKIPPED + 0.9.5 DOMAIN ✅ OR SKIPPED (engineering default).**

Print one-liner BEFORE starting §1 Git Housekeeping:
```
🟢 ALL 5 EXECUTABLE SHIP GATES PASSED (scope-checker 6-checks · code-review · compliance-heavy · qa[minimal|normal|full] · domain-gates[<slug or skipped>])
Proceeding to Git Housekeeping §1 → atomic conventional commit → push → open DRAFT PR.
```

Append FINAL entry via official decision log helper:
```bash
che_append_decision_jsonl "ALL_SHIP_GATES_PASSED" "gates=[0.9.1,0.9.2,0.9.3,0.9.4,0.9.5] scores_scope=${score} effective_domain=${effective_domain} related_id=${RELATED_ID}"
```

**Post-gates blacklist reminder:** All reports above were written EXCLUSIVELY in `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/report/${RELATED_ID}/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-*.{md,log,json}` (centralised helper built all paths). §0.8 blacklist stage 1-2 already ran and will continue to run in §2.2 before each commit to ensure NONE of these reports or decision artifacts accidentally enter user diff.

---

## 1. STEP 1 — Git Housekeeping (inside WORKTREE_ROOT)

### 1.1 Git sanitisation check (secret scan pre-commit, extra)

Run a quick grep BEFORE staging anything (use che-compliance skill Category 1 + 2 patterns on the DIFF against default branch).
If any matches → block, report, offer to unstage / remove the problematic file, do NOT proceed.

### 1.2 Determine the following

Run these one by one and record results:
- **Current branch**: `git branch --show-current` → `<BRANCH_NAME>`
- **Default remote branch**: `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name` → usually `main` or `master`. Call it `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>`.
- **Remote tracking branch exists?**: `git ls-remote --heads origin <BRANCH_NAME>` → empty = does not exist yet; we'll create on push.
- **Staged vs unstaged files**: list both

### 1.3 Worktree path absolute guard

If any git command runs and it turns out the current directory is NOT the provided worktree root → fail immediately, do not run any commit/push against wrong directory.

---

## 2. STEP 2 — Build atomic conventional commits

This is the user's requested default: conventional commits + atomic.

### 2.1 Generate proposed commit plan

Look at the diff. `git diff --name-only <DEFAULT_BRANCH>...HEAD` (or vs staged).

**BLACKLIST FILTER — ALWAYS run BEFORE grouping:**
From the diff-name-only output, REMOVE all files matching the patterns in §0.8 BLACKLIST (`.trae/**`, `decisions.log*`, `decision.log*`, `task_graph.md`, `manual_test_plan.md`, `final_summary.md`, `execution_batches.md`, `batch_execution_report.md`, `merge_audit.*`, `scope-report.*`, `scope_check_report.*`, `spec_*.md`, `gh_stack_plan.md`, `session.md`, `envelope.md`, `task_envelope.md`, `graphify-out/**`, `*review-report.md`).
- If any of those files appear in the diff → §0.8 preflight SHOULD have cleaned them already. If still present → **DO NOT ADD TO ANY COMMIT.** Skip silently and add 1 note at the bottom of the commit plan: "Note: N planning-artifact files auto-skipped (never committed)."

Group the remaining (filtered) changes into atomic, logical commits:

- **feat(scope):** new functionality, new endpoints, new UI components
- **fix(scope):** bug fixes — include "Fixes #TICKET" if applicable
- **refactor(scope):** code move, rename, no behavior change
- **test(scope):** spec files, e2e, fixtures only
- **docs(scope):** markdown, README, docstrings, no runtime
- **chore(scope):** deps bump, config, CI file changes, migrations
- **perf(scope):** perf improvements with measurable impact
- **build(scope):** build scripts, nx config, package.json
- **style(scope):** Biome/format, indentation, CSS-only cosmetic
- **ci(scope):** GitHub Actions, workflows
- **revert(scope):** reverts prior commit

Rule for grouping:
- If a change can stand alone (migration separate from runtime code that uses it) → separate commits.
- Tests for a feature go WITH the feature commit, not in separate, unless the feature is already merged.
- Migrations: usually `chore(db): add migration for X` separate commit.
- Max 15 commits per ship. If > 15 → offer user option to squash into fewer + plan, or proceed with 15+.

Present commit plan to the user as a **numbered list**, in order of application. Add the "N planning artifacts skipped" note at the bottom if applicable.
Wait for explicit user APPROVAL before running any `git commit`.

### 2.2 Execution — apply the commits (AFTER USER APPROVES plan)

Run each commit:
```
# BEFORE every commit: unstage ANY blacklisted files that somehow re-entered the index.
git reset HEAD -- \
  .trae  decisions.log.jsonl  decisions.log.md  decisions.log \
        decision.log.jsonl   decision.log.md   decision.log \
  task_graph.md manual_test_plan.md final_summary.md \
  execution_batches.md batch_execution_report.md \
  merge_audit.md merge_audit.jsonl \
  scope-report.md scope-report.json scope_check_report.md scope_check_report.json \
  spec_*.md gh_stack_plan.md session.md envelope.md task_envelope.md \
  graphify-out che-review-report.md che-compliance-report.md flockr-review-report.md \
  2>/dev/null || true

git add <files for this commit>
git commit -m "type(scope): imperative description in English, lowercase, max 72 chars"
```
Rules:
- NEVER run `git add .` — always add per-file or per-directory explicitly.
- Before EVERY `git add`, run the `git reset HEAD -- <blacklist patterns>` line above. (Fail-closed — cost 1 ms per commit, prevents a whole class of PR-pollution bugs.)
- Every commit message in **ENGLISH** (Header and Body), following the **Storytelling Conventional Commit** rule.
- After last commit → run `git log --oneline -20` to present final chain to user.
- **POST-COMMIT ASSERT (after all commits applied):** `git show --name-only --pretty=format: HEAD~10..HEAD` → scan file names for §0.8 blacklist patterns. If any commit contains a blacklisted file → **STOP, DO NOT PUSH.** Report to user, offer `git reset HEAD~N` + re-apply cleanly, then continue.

### 2.3 GH_STACK_MODE=true — Group commits PER LAYER (bottom-up)

**ONLY run when `GH_STACK_MODE=true`. Overrides 2.1/2.2 default flat plan; standard flat commits become per-layer grouped commits.**

For each layer `L[i]` in `LAYERS[]` (bottom-up order, starting with the lowest stack layer):

1. **Checkout / create layer branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <L[i].BranchName>   # if branch doesn't exist locally yet
   # or: git checkout <L[i].BranchName>  # if already exists
   ```
2. **Cherry-pick OR stage only files in layer scope**:
   - Strategy A (preferred when commit plan already aligns): cherry-pick only the commits relevant to this layer onto this branch from the consolidated work branch.
   - Strategy B (simpler fallback — use when scope-per-layer is clearly file-based): from worktree state, **FIRST run `git reset HEAD -- <blacklist patterns>` (same as §2.2)** then `git add <only files matching L[i].Scope (files)>`, then create 1 or more conventional commits scoped EXCLUSIVELY to this layer (no cross-layer files in same commit).
3. Present plan of "branch → commits → scope" to user as numbered list. **Wait for explicit user APPROVAL before applying any layer commit.**
4. After user approves: apply commits per layer. Record per-layer: final commit SHAs.
5. After all layers done: present to user summary "Layers bottom-up (N layers): L1 → 2 commits; L2 → 3 commits; L3 → 1 commit" etc.

Rule invariant for GH_STACK_MODE commits:
- **Every file in a given layer's commit MUST be listed in L[i].Scope (files).** If a file belongs to layer L[i+1] it MUST NOT appear in commits of L[i]. Any cross-layer file → block, ask user which layer gets it.
- **Additional GH-stack invariant:** Zero files from §0.8 BLACKLIST allowed in ANY layer's commit. If after building layer the index contains a blacklist file → `git reset HEAD -- <file>` and warn.

---

## 3. STEP 3 — Push with `--no-verify`

User's rule: default to `--no-verify` for push.

### Path A: GH_STACK_MODE=false (single branch, standard)

```bash
# Case 1: remote branch does NOT exist yet
git push --no-verify --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>

# Case 2: remote branch already exists (ahead/behind)
git push --no-verify
```

Wait for success. If push fails:
- Non-fast-forward → ask user: rebase or force push? NEVER force push without explicit confirmation.
- Auth failure → stop.

### Path B: GH_STACK_MODE=true (push each layer bottom-up)

Loop layers in bottom-up order:

For each layer `L[i]` in `LAYERS[]`:
```bash
git checkout <L[i].BranchName>
# Case 1: remote branch doesn't exist
git push --no-verify --set-upstream origin <L[i].BranchName>
# Case 2: remote branch exists
git push --no-verify
```

Push failure rule same as Path A (per layer; block on first failure, don't continue to upper layers).

---

## 4. STEP 4 — Open DRAFT PR(s) against default branch

### Common Step: 4.0 Detect Linear/Jira ticket reference (both paths)

Look in:
- `.trae/<task-id>/session.md` for field "Ticket URL/ID"
- Branch name pattern: `feat/PROJ-123-login`, `fix/PROJ-456`, `ticket PROJ-123` anywhere in session/task_graph/envelope files
- User command args: `/che-ship ticket:PROJ-123`

If found ticket: extract `<TICKET-ID>` (full URL or just ID). Append `Refs: <TICKET-ID>` footer to EVERY PR body (single OR all layers in stack).

---

### Path A: GH_STACK_MODE=false (single PR, standard)

#### A-4.2 Build PR Description — READABLE 5 BLOCKS (ENGLISH by default, ≤50 lines TOTAL target)

> **Canonical body + FILLED real EXAMPLE (refund feature from screenshot, low-context readable version):** `references/PR_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md` (Layer 3 SOLE owner of structure/content + readability rules). Below only process budgets.
> **Copy the STYLE of the filled example in PR_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md, not only the section names.** The filled example shows exactly how to phrase bullets, acronym expansion, user impact, and risk consequence.

**LANGUAGE GATE (non-negotiable — #1 rule, before any writing):**
- **DEFAULT = ENGLISH (EN-US / EN-GB).** Write the ENTIRE PR body, headings, bullets, ticket refs, commands — EVERYTHING — in English.
- **Other language ONLY IF:** the user explicitly requests another language.
- **Never guess / NEVER assume.** Absent an explicit mention → PR body is ALWAYS English.

**PROCESS GATES (non-negotiable — readable for low-context reviewers, trim only the useless, never the clear context):**

1. **Block 1 — What was implemented:** bullets only, 3–8 items. No paragraphs. **MANDATORY pattern per bullet:** `feat|fix|chore(scope): <WHAT changed in plain English>. <1 short sentence WHY / end-user impact>.` **READABILITY sub-rules (from template §RULES 1-3):**
   - **Acronyms expanded on FIRST use** inside the bullet (example: "RLS (Row-Level Security — Postgres access control)"). After first use → acronym alone is OK.
   - **Avoid concatenating 5–10 micro-changes into 1 monster bullet.** Each `feat(scope)` line = ONE self-contained area (DB schema / entity / service / Stripe / API / UI / tests — 1 bullet each, not 8 changes jammed).
   - **Internal jargon gets ½-line context** (example: "reverse_transfer (Stripe Connect — money moves from the connected org account back to the platform, then to the buyer)" not just "reverse_transfer=true").
   - If >8 bullets → PR is too large (split into gh-stack, §Path B).
2. **Block 2 — 🔍 Attention points:** bullets only, 3 IDEAL, 5 MAX. **MANDATORY pattern per bullet:** `**Risk label:** \`path/or filename\` — <what is risky, plain English>. **If review misses this:** <plain-English consequence — what actually breaks for users/devs>.` Risk labels (rename jargon to the readable versions below):
   - ✅ Use: `Security-sensitive` · `Performance-sensitive` · `Schema change (DDL migration)` · `Cross-module change` · `Concurrency / race condition` · `Product decision`
   - ❌ Stop using: `Blast-radius` (too vague — say what it actually hits)
   - If >5 bullets → split gh-stack.
3. **Block 3 — 💥 Breaking changes:** **INCLUDE ONLY IF they EXIST.** If NONE → DELETE the ENTIRE "Breaking changes" section (do NOT write "NONE", do NOT leave an empty section). When including: 1 heading per breaking change + Before / After / Migration bullets.
4. **Block 4 — 🧪 How to verify:** bullets only, 1–3 items, IN THIS ORDER:
   - (a) **Automated tests:** CONCRETE COMMAND pointing to a SPECIFIC test + 1 sentence what is covered + 1 expected-result sentence ("Expected: 1/1 passing green").
   - (b) **Quick manual check:** 2–3 CONCRETE steps with numbered parens, NO assumed folder-structure knowledge, always state the EXPECTED VISIBLE outcome (not "test it works").
   - (c) **Full plan (optional):** link to `$CHE_WORKSPACE_SHARED/manual_test_plan.md`
5. **Block 5 — 🔗 Refs:** Linear/Jira ticket (ID + URL). Optionally 1 extra link (Figma, PRD .md path, related PR number).
6. **FORBIDDEN sections (always delete if they creep in):** Scope In/Out, Assumptions adopted, long What/Why intro paragraphs, Che gates checklist, giant tables, 2-paragraph context intro. (The "why" lives INSIDE each Block 1 bullet, NOT as a preamble.)
7. **Body budget:** ≤50 lines TOTAL (all 5 blocks + headings summed). No breaking → target ~30 lines. With breaking → target ~45 lines. If over → move long migration/design details into a separate linked doc + keep 1 summary line in Block 2 or 3. **Do NOT butcher acronyms/user-impact sentences to save 2 lines — save by cutting forbidden prose instead.**

**Linear ticket auto-include (A-4.0 common step):** When a ticket is detected (A-4.0), ALWAYS include it in Block 5 "Refs". Do NOT duplicate the ref in a separate footer/comment.

#### A-4.3 Create PR (Draft, not ready for review)

```bash
gh pr create \
  --draft \
  --base <DEFAULT_BRANCH> \
  --head <BRANCH_NAME> \
  --title "<conventional commit style title, more descriptive: feat(auth): implement Stripe Connect onboarding>" \
  --body-file <tmpfile_with_pr_description.md>
```

Capture the created PR URL: `<PR_URL>`.

#### A-4.4 Assign to user + labels

```bash
gh pr edit <PR_URL> --add-assignee @me
# Optional: add existing labels (type: bug/feature, needs review, security, breaking-change)
# Only add labels that EXIST in repo.
```

---

### Path B: GH_STACK_MODE=true (hierarchical PR stack via gh-stack)

#### B-4.2 Per-layer PR body + Depends-on chain (bottom-up)

For each layer `L[i]` in `LAYERS[]` (bottom-up order):
1. Build a PR description SCOPED EXCLUSIVELY to `L[i]` — same **READABLE 5-block structure + readability rules from Path A §A-4.2** (acronym expansion, user-impact per bullet, risk-consequence explanation, non-jargon labels, plain-language How-to-verify). Body is SCOPED TO ONLY the layer's changes (no cross-layer leaks).
   - **Depends on header (CANONICAL gh-stack)**:
     - If `L[i].Depends on` is non-empty → PREPEND block to the **TOP of PR body** (before the 5 blocks):
       ```
       Depends on: #<PR-ID-of-L[i-1]>
       ---
       ```
       (Use the numeric PR ID, not the full URL.)
     - If first layer (base, no Depends on) → skip this header.
   - Append: related ticket footer `Refs: <TICKET-ID>` inside Block 5 (🔗 Refs).
   - NO assumptions paragraphs / NO che checklists. **Body total ≤35 lines per layer** (relaxed vs single PR because stack layers are smaller). Still enforce the readable style from PR_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md filled example.
2. Write each layer body to `<tmp>_layer_<L[i].ID>_body.md`.

#### B-4.3 Create each layer PR individually + gh-stack link

Loop layers **bottom-up**:
For each layer `L[i]`:
```bash
# Ensure on correct layer branch:
git checkout <L[i].BranchName>

# Create DRAFT PR for THIS layer:
gh pr create \
  --draft \
  --base <if first layer: DEFAULT_BRANCH; else: L[i].Depends on layer's branch> \
  --head <L[i].BranchName> \
  --title "<L[i].ID>: <layer scope descriptive conventional title>" \
  --body-file <tmp>_layer_<L[i].ID>_body.md
```
- Capture each layer's PR URL: `L[i].PR_URL` AND numeric PR ID: `L[i].PR_NUMBER`.
- After PR created: self-assign: `gh pr edit <L[i].PR_URL> --add-assignee @me`.

After **all individual layer PRs are created + assigned**:
```bash
# Run gh-stack to formalize the Depends-on hierarchy:
gh-stack create --draft
```
This validates the chain; if errors → fix base/head references manually per layer.

#### B-4.4 Stack invariant check

After gh-stack create: verify the chain:
- Layer 1 (base) PR `base: DEFAULT_BRANCH` → correct.
- Layer N PR `base: L[N-1] branch` AND body has `Depends on: #<L[N-1].PR_NUMBER>` → correct.
If mismatch → report to user; offer to fix via `gh pr edit --base` or body edit; wait approval.

  2. Review the PR diff to ensure no unintended files entered.
  3. When all ok: open PR <PR_URL>, click "Ready for review" and assign reviewers.
```

### Path B: GH_STACK_MODE=true (hierarchical PR stack report)

Final output to user chat:

PR Stack (merge order = base first to top):
───────────────────────────────────────────────
L1 (base, merged first) →
   branch: <L1.BranchName>

(Validate each layer's behaviour individually before marking the stack as ready.)

Next steps (review order = same bottom-up merge order):
  1. Run individual smoke tests in each layer starting from L1 (base).
  2. Review diffs one PR at a time — always L[i] PR review BEFORE L[i+1].
  3. When L[i] approved + merged: gh-stack automatically updates L[i+1] base → repeat until LN.
  4. Only after LN merged: click "Ready for review" on the top-level, or follow normal flow per layer.

## Appendix A: Hard stops / What we will NEVER do

- Commit files with `.env` in name OR any file matching secrets regex patterns.
- Push against a branch you are NOT currently on.
- Commit directly to `main` / `master` / default branch. Block. Always: feature branch → PR.
- Force push without explicit user confirmation.
- Merge the PR. Ship stops at DRAFT PR creation + assign.
